# Crop-Production-Analysis

Libraries used - Pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn

● The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify errors in data sets. Give a better
understanding of the relationship between various attributes in the dataset.
<br />
● Historical crop yield information is also important for supply chain operation of companies engaged in industries. These
industries use agricultural products as raw material, food, animal feed, fertilizer, seed and paper.
<br />
● After Analysing dataset I got to know that highest contribution in the crop production is given by south India.
<br />
● I have used linear regression to predict crop production.

Note- Model has overfitting working on to takle overfitting
